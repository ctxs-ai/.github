ctxs.ai is a community-curated registry of context windows. 

- A centralized hub for discovering context windows 
- An MCP server to integrate with your workflows (soon ✨)

## Why should this exist?

- LLMs are trained with large datasets, constrained by a training cut off date
- Providing more precise context about a project, libraries used, available tools and frameworks improves model performance
- IDEs like Cursor are starting develop their own indexing system but this makes it hard to share what’s working
- Serve as an open-source “deterministic checkpoint” that can be used for evals
- Allow library / framework authors to publish LLM-targeted docs
